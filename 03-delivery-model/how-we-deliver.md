# How We Deliver

## Delivery Philosophy

Delivery in this model is structured around **control, predictability, and informed decision-making** rather than raw execution speed.

The objective is not to optimize for maximum throughput, but to ensure that:
- Work progresses with clear ownership  
- Decisions are documented and reversible where possible  
- Risks are identified early and managed explicitly  
- Distributed teams operate within well-defined boundaries  

Delivery is treated as a governance process, not a production line.

## Engagement Lifecycle

A typical engagement follows a structured lifecycle:

1. **Context Alignment**  
   - Understanding business objectives and constraints  
   - Identifying regulatory, operational, and technical boundaries  
   - Clarifying roles and decision authority  

2. **Scope and Boundary Definition**  
   - Defining what is in scope and what is not  
   - Establishing acceptance criteria and quality expectations  
   - Agreeing on communication and escalation paths  

3. **Delivery Oversight**  
   - Continuous review of designs and implementation  
   - Mediation between stakeholders and developers  
   - Early identification of deviations and risks  

4. **Stabilization and Handover**  
   - Validation of documentation and operational readiness  
   - Knowledge transfer and ownership clarification  
   - Final alignment on next steps or disengagement

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Client

- Owns business decisions and priorities  
- Provides timely input and approvals  
- Assigns a clear business and technical counterpart  

### Application Engineering (Intermediary)

- Provides technical governance and oversight  
- Ensures alignment with agreed standards  
- Facilitates communication and resolves ambiguity  
- Escalates risks and trade-offs explicitly  

### Delivery Teams

- Execute according to defined specifications  
- Produce verifiable and reviewable artifacts  
- Respect agreed communication and documentation standards  

Roles are intentionally non-overlapping to avoid ambiguity.

## Communication Model

Communication is:
- Structured  
- Documented  
- Purpose-driven  

Typical practices include:
- Written decision records  
- Asynchronous updates where possible  
- Escalation based on impact, not hierarchy  

Meetings are used sparingly and only when they materially reduce uncertainty.

---

## Quality and Control Mechanisms

Quality is enforced through:
- Explicit acceptance criteria  
- Design and code reviews  
- Documentation requirements  
- Observability and operational readiness checks  

Quality gates exist to prevent silent degradation, not to block progress arbitrarily.

---

## Risk Management

Risks are:
- Identified early  
- Classified by impact and likelihood  
- Communicated transparently  
- Owned explicitly  

This model avoids implicit risk transfer and makes trade-offs visible.

---

## Exit and Continuity

Engagements are designed to:
- Avoid dependency  
- Enable clean disengagement  
- Leave systems understandable and maintainable  

The goal is continuity without lock-in.

---

## Summary

Delivery in this model prioritizes:
- Clarity over speed  
- Accountability over volume  
- Sustainability over short-term optimization  

This approach is deliberately conservative and suited to environments where failure has real cost.
