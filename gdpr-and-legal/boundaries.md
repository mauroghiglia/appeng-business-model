# GDPR and Legal Boundaries

## Purpose

This document defines the legal and regulatory boundaries within which the delivery model operates, with particular focus on **GDPR compliance and EU legal constraints**.

The intent is not to provide legal advice, but to establish **clear operational assumptions** and prevent implicit or unmanaged legal risk.

---

## Regulatory Context

All engagements are assumed to operate within:
- The **European Union legal framework**
- The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
- Applicable national implementations and sector-specific regulations  

Any deviation from this context must be explicitly identified and assessed before engagement.

---

## Data Protection Roles

Clear definition of data protection roles is mandatory.

Typically:
- The **client** acts as *Data Controller*  
- Delivery teams act as *Data Processors*  
- Application Engineering operates as a **governance and advisory intermediary**, unless explicitly contracted otherwise  

Role ambiguity is treated as a compliance risk.

---

## Data Access Boundaries

Access to personal or sensitive data must be:
- Justified by delivery needs  
- Minimized by design  
- Logged and reviewable  

The model discourages unrestricted access and favors:
- Anonymization  
- Pseudonymization  
- Environment segregation  

---

## Geographic and Jurisdictional Constraints

Data residency and cross-border access are explicitly addressed.

Key principles:
- Data location must be known and documented  
- Transfers outside the EU require explicit legal basis  
- Jurisdictional implications are evaluated before execution  

Assumptions about “acceptable” access are not permitted.

---

## Third-Party Involvement

When third parties are involved:
- Their role and responsibilities must be contractually defined  
- Sub-processing must be explicitly authorized  
- Compliance obligations must be flowed down  

Undisclosed subcontracting is unacceptable.

---

## Security as a Legal Requirement

Security controls are treated as part of compliance, not as optional best practices.

This includes:
- Access control  
- Auditability  
- Incident response readiness  

Security gaps are considered legal exposure.

---

## Documentation and Evidence

Compliance must be demonstrable.

This requires:
- Documented decisions  
- Traceable data flows  
- Evidence of applied controls  

“In practice” compliance without evidence is insufficient.

---

## Boundaries of Responsibility

This model does **not**:
- Replace legal counsel  
- Assume controller responsibilities by default  
- Provide certification or formal compliance guarantees  

Legal accountability remains with the appropriate contractual parties.

---

## Risk Disclosure and Escalation

Identified legal or compliance risks are:
- Communicated explicitly  
- Escalated based on impact  
- Documented when accepted  

Silent risk acceptance is not permitted.

---

## Summary

These boundaries exist to:
- Prevent implicit legal exposure  
- Ensure informed decision-making  
- Align delivery practices with EU regulatory reality  

Compliance is treated as a design constraint, not an afterthought.
