# Technical Governance

This section defines the principles used to govern technical decisions and system evolution.

It establishes how architecture, quality, documentation, observability, and change are managed to prevent uncontrolled complexity and long-term degradation.

These principles apply regardless of team size, technology stack, or delivery location.
