# Why This Model Exists

## The Problem Observed

Over the years, traditional outsourcing and nearshoring models have consistently shown structural weaknesses, especially for small and medium-sized companies operating in regulated or quality-sensitive environments.

Common issues include:
- Lack of real technical ownership  
- Communication gaps between business and developers  
- Misaligned incentives focused on volume rather than outcomes  
- Weak governance, documentation, and long-term maintainability  
- Superficial handling of GDPR and EU regulatory constraints  

For many SMEs, outsourcing has become synonymous with loss of control rather than efficiency.

## The Missing Layer

Most outsourcing models assume that clients can:
- Define requirements precisely  
- Evaluate technical decisions  
- Enforce quality and security standards  
- Manage distributed teams effectively  

In practice, this is rarely true.

What is usually missing is a **trusted technical and cultural intermediary**—someone who:
- Understands the client’s business context  
- Speaks the client’s language (linguistically and culturally)  
- Has the technical authority to challenge poor decisions  
- Operates fully within the EU legal and regulatory framework  

This model exists to provide that missing layer.

## Why Mediation Matters

Distributed development does not fail because of geography alone.  
It fails because of **unmediated complexity**.

Differences in:
- Language  
- Work culture  
- Risk perception  
- Documentation standards  
- Regulatory awareness  

compound quickly without governance.

By acting as an intermediary, this model:
- Reduces ambiguity  
- Filters noise before it becomes cost  
- Aligns incentives across all parties  
- Preserves accountability

## Why This Fits SMEs Better Than Large Vendors

Large vendors optimize for scale.  
This model optimizes for **clarity and responsibility**.

For SMEs:
- Every architectural decision matters  
- Every delay has business impact  
- Every compliance mistake has disproportionate risk  

This approach prioritizes:
- Explicit boundaries  
- Transparent decision-making  
- Sustainable delivery over short-term velocity

## What This Model Is — and Is Not

### This model **is**:
- A governance and delivery framework  
- A bridge between business and engineering  
- A risk-reduction mechanism  
- A long-term collaboration model  

### This model **is not**:
- Body leasing  
- Staff augmentation without oversight  
- A “cheap development” promise  
- A replacement for internal ownership

## The Intended Outcome

The objective is not to maximize output, but to ensure that:
- Software remains understandable and maintainable  
- Decisions are traceable and defensible  
- Compliance is designed in, not patched later  
- Clients retain strategic and technical control  

This model exists to make distributed software development **predictable, accountable, and aligned with EU realities**.
