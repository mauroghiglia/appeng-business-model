## Who This Model Is For

This model is designed for organizations that value **clarity, accountability, and long-term sustainability** over short-term cost optimization.

It is particularly suited for:
- Small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the EU  
- Companies in regulated or compliance-sensitive environments  
- Organizations lacking strong internal technical governance  
- Businesses that need distributed development without losing control  

Clients who recognize software as a strategic asset—not a disposable commodity—benefit most from this approach.

---

## Who This Model Is Not For

This model is intentionally **not universal**.

It is **not** suitable for:
- Organizations seeking the lowest possible development cost  
- Clients expecting rapid scaling through interchangeable resources  
- Projects with undefined ownership or unclear decision authority  
- Environments where technical debt is accepted as a normal outcome  

If speed and volume matter more than correctness, this model is not a good fit.

## Why This Model Exists in the Market

Most outsourcing offerings fall into one of two extremes:
- Large vendors optimized for scale and process  
- Small teams offering low-cost execution with minimal governance  

This model occupies the **deliberate middle ground**:
- Independent from large vendor inertia  
- More structured and accountable than ad-hoc outsourcing  

It exists to serve clients who need **control without bureaucracy**.

---

## Competitive Differentiation

Key differentiators include:
- Clear separation of roles and responsibilities  
- Explicit technical and architectural ownership  
- Active mediation between business and engineering  
- EU-centric legal and regulatory awareness  
- Preference for maintainability over short-term velocity  

The value lies not in execution capacity, but in **decision quality**.

---

## Engagement Philosophy

Engagements are structured to:
- Minimize ambiguity early  
- Surface risks before they materialize  
- Preserve client autonomy  
- Avoid long-term dependency  

The objective is to build **durable systems and informed clients**, not contractual lock-in.

---

## Strategic Boundary

This model deliberately limits its scope.

It does not attempt to:
- Replace internal teams  
- Compete with large system integrators  
- Offer fixed-price guarantees detached from reality  

Instead, it focuses on **guidance, governance, and alignment**.

---

## Summary

This is a model for organizations that prefer:
- Fewer surprises over faster delivery  
- Explicit trade-offs over implicit assumptions  
- Long-term clarity over short-term savings  

If those priorities resonate, this model is likely a good fit.
