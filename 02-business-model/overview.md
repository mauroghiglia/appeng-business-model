# Business Model Overview

## Purpose of the Model

The purpose of this business model is to provide **technical governance, mediation, and delivery oversight** for software projects involving distributed development teams.

Rather than selling development capacity, this model sells **clarity, control, and risk reduction** across the full lifecycle of a software initiative.

---

## Core Value Proposition

Clients engage this model to:
- Retain strategic and technical control  
- Reduce execution and compliance risk  
- Improve decision quality and traceability  
- Enable distributed development without organizational overload  

The value is generated through **governance and alignment**, not through volume-based delivery.

---

## What Is Being Sold

The offering typically includes:
- Technical and architectural oversight  
- Mediation between business stakeholders and development teams  
- Definition and enforcement of delivery standards  
- Review of designs, code, and documentation  
- Advisory support on compliance and operational readiness  

Execution may be performed by third-party teams, internal teams, or a hybrid model.

---

## Revenue Model

Engagements are typically structured as:
- **Retainer-based consulting**, ensuring continuity and availability  
- **Time-based advisory support** for well-defined scopes  
- **Project-based governance**, with explicit boundaries  

This model avoids revenue structures that depend on headcount or delivery volume, as they create misaligned incentives.

---

## Client Responsibilities

For the model to function effectively, clients are expected to:
- Assign a clear business owner  
- Accept that not all risks can be eliminated  
- Participate in decision-making when required  
- Respect defined governance boundaries  

This is a collaborative model, not a delegation of accountability.

---

## Boundaries and Exclusions

The model explicitly does **not** include:
- Staff augmentation without governance  
- Ownership of business decisions  
- Guarantees on delivery speed detached from constraints  
- Responsibility for third-party contractual performance  

Clear boundaries are a prerequisite for trust and sustainability.

---

## Risk and Incentive Alignment

This business model is designed to:
- Surface risks early  
- Make trade-offs explicit  
- Avoid dependency or lock-in  
- Preserve client autonomy  

Success is measured by **system stability and decision quality**, not by short-term throughput.

---

## Scalability Considerations

The model scales by:
- Limiting the number of concurrent engagements  
- Maintaining direct involvement at key decision points  
- Preferring depth of engagement over breadth  

This ensures consistency and preserves accountability.

---

## Summary

This business model exists to support organizations that need:
- Distributed development without chaos  
- Governance without bureaucracy  
- External expertise without loss of ownership  

It is intentionally conservative, clarity-driven, and sustainability-oriented.
