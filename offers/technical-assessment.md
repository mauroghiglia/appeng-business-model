# Technical Assessment and Due Diligence

## Objective

The Technical Assessment and Due Diligence engagement provides an **independent, structured evaluation** of existing software systems, delivery practices, and technical risk exposure.

Its purpose is to give decision-makers a **clear, evidence-based understanding** of the current state of a system before committing to change, investment, or transition.

---

## When This Engagement Is Appropriate

This engagement is suitable when:
- Acquiring, inheriting, or taking over an existing system  
- Planning a major redesign, migration, or scaling initiative  
- Experiencing recurring delivery or operational issues  
- Evaluating third-party delivery performance or proposals  

It is often used as a **precondition** for larger engagements.

---

## Scope of the Engagement

The assessment typically covers:
- System architecture and technical structure  
- Codebase health and maintainability indicators  
- Delivery and governance practices  
- Documentation quality and traceability  
- Operational readiness and observability  
- Compliance-relevant technical aspects  

The scope is tailored to the client’s context and risk profile.

---

## Assessment Approach

The approach is:
- Evidence-driven  
- Time-bounded  
- Proportionate to system criticality  

It may include:
- Documentation and artifact review  
- Targeted interviews with stakeholders  
- Limited code or configuration inspection  
- Review of operational data where available  

The goal is insight, not exhaustive analysis.

---

## Deliverables

Typical deliverables include:
- A written assessment report  
- Identified risks and areas of concern  
- Prioritized recommendations  
- Explicit assumptions and limitations  

Findings are presented in a form suitable for technical and non-technical stakeholders.

---

## Client Responsibilities

The client is expected to:
- Provide access to relevant materials and stakeholders  
- Clarify assessment objectives and constraints  
- Accept that findings may challenge assumptions  
- Retain ownership of follow-up decisions  

The assessment informs decisions; it does not make them.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

This engagement does **not** include:
- Full code audits or penetration testing  
- Remediation or implementation work  
- Guarantees on future performance  
- Certification or formal compliance attestation  

Any extension beyond assessment must be explicitly agreed.

---

## Duration and Exit

- Engagements are short and time-bounded  
- A clear end date is defined upfront  
- The assessment concludes with delivery of findings  

There is no implied follow-on engagement.

---

## Success Criteria

Success is measured by:
- Clarity of system state and risks  
- Actionable, prioritized recommendations  
- Informed decision-making by the client  

---

## Summary

The Technical Assessment and Due Diligence engagement is designed to **reduce uncertainty before commitment**.

It provides an objective foundation for planning, investment, or governance decisions without creating dependency or execution obligations.
