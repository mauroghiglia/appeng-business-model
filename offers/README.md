# Engagement Models

## Purpose

This section defines the **engagement models** through which clients can work with Application Engineering.

The intent is not to offer a broad catalog of services, but to provide **clear, bounded entry points** into the delivery and governance model documented in this repository.

Each engagement model is designed to preserve alignment, accountability, and long-term sustainability—for both client and consultant.

---

## Offer Philosophy

This model deliberately avoids:
- Body leasing and staff augmentation  
- Open-ended execution responsibility  
- Pricing structures tied to headcount or volume  
- Implicit ownership of business decisions  

Instead, engagements are structured to:
- Clarify responsibilities early  
- Make risks and trade-offs explicit  
- Preserve client autonomy  
- Avoid dependency and lock-in  

The objective is to support informed decision-making, not to absorb accountability that properly belongs elsewhere.

---

## How to Read the Offers

Each engagement model describes:
- **Objective** – what problem the engagement addresses  
- **Typical scope and duration** – indicative, not contractual  
- **Deliverables** – what is concretely produced  
- **Client responsibilities** – prerequisites for success  
- **Explicit exclusions** – what is not included  

If an engagement cannot be described clearly using these elements, it is intentionally not offered.

## Available Engagement Models

The following engagement models are defined in this section:

- [**Advisory and Governance Retainer**](/offers/advisory-and-governance-retainer.md)
  Ongoing technical governance, mediation, and advisory support for organizations running distributed development initiatives.

- [**Project Governance Engagement** ](/offers/project-governance.md) 
  Time-bound governance and oversight for a specific project or delivery phase.

- [**Technical Assessment and Due Diligence**](/offers/technical-assessment.md)
  Independent evaluation of systems, architecture, delivery practices, and risk exposure.

- [**Transition or Recovery Engagement**](/offers/transition-or-recovery.md)
  Short-term intervention to stabilize, realign, or transition ownership of an existing initiative.

Each model is documented separately and can be adapted in scope, but not in principle.

---

## What These Offers Are Not

These engagements are **not** intended to:
- Replace internal technical leadership  
- Compete with system integrators or delivery vendors  
- Guarantee delivery outcomes outside defined control  
- Absorb legal, regulatory, or business accountability  

Clear boundaries are a prerequisite for trust and effectiveness.

---

## Pricing and Commercial Terms

Pricing is:
- Context-dependent  
- Discussed directly with clients  
- Aligned with scope, risk, and level of involvement  

This repository intentionally avoids publishing price lists or rates, as they are meaningless without context.

---

## Selection Guidance

Clients are encouraged to select an engagement model based on:
- The level of uncertainty they face  
- The maturity of their internal capabilities  
- The degree of risk they need to control  

When in doubt, starting with a **limited assessment or governance engagement** is usually the most effective approach.

---

## Summary

These engagement models exist to provide:
- Predictable collaboration  
- Explicit boundaries  
- High decision quality  

They are intentionally conservative, limited in number, and designed to scale through clarity rather than volume.
