# Transition or Recovery Engagement

## Objective

The Transition or Recovery Engagement provides **short-term, focused intervention** to stabilize, realign, or transfer ownership of a software initiative that is experiencing disruption, loss of control, or impending change.

Its purpose is to restore **clarity, governance, and decision capability** during periods of elevated risk.

---

## When This Engagement Is Appropriate

This engagement is suitable when:
- A project is stalled or deteriorating  
- Technical ownership is unclear or contested  
- Delivery quality or predictability has degraded  
- A transition between teams, vendors, or internal ownership is planned  
- A rapid, independent assessment is required to regain control  

It is explicitly designed for **non-steady-state situations**.

---

## Scope of the Engagement

The engagement typically includes:
- Rapid assessment of current technical and delivery state  
- Identification of critical risks and failure points  
- Clarification of roles, responsibilities, and decision authority  
- Definition of immediate stabilization actions  
- Guidance on transition or recovery paths  

The scope is intentionally narrow and time-bound.

---

## Engagement Structure and Duration

- Engagements are short-term by design  
- Initial focus is on stabilization and clarity  
- Activities are prioritized based on risk and impact  

This model avoids prolonged intervention without clear progress.

---

## Deliverables

Typical deliverables include:
- A written recovery or transition assessment  
- Prioritized risk and issue list  
- Clear recommendations for next steps  
- Governance and ownership realignment guidance  

Deliverables are pragmatic and decision-oriented.

---

## Client Responsibilities

The client is expected to:
- Provide rapid access to relevant information and stakeholders  
- Empower decisive action where required  
- Accept that not all issues can be resolved immediately  
- Retain ownership of final decisions and execution  

Effective recovery requires active client participation.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

This engagement does **not** include:
- Long-term execution or delivery ownership  
- Replacement of internal leadership  
- Guarantees of project success  
- Resolution of contractual disputes  

The engagement focuses on **technical and governance recovery**, not legal arbitration.

---

## Exit and Handover

- The engagement concludes once stabilization objectives are met  
- Findings and recommendations are formally handed over  
- Ongoing governance may continue under a different engagement model  

Clean exit is a core design principle.

---

## Success Criteria

Success is measured by:
- Restored clarity of ownership and responsibility  
- Reduced immediate delivery risk  
- Actionable recovery or transition plan  
- Improved decision-making capability  

---

## Summary

The Transition or Recovery Engagement exists to help organizations **regain control during critical moments**.

It prioritizes stabilization, clarity, and safe transition over short-term delivery acceleration.
