# Project Governance Engagement

## Objective

The Project Governance Engagement provides **focused, time-bound technical governance and oversight** for a specific software project or delivery phase.

Its objective is to ensure that key decisions, delivery practices, and risk controls remain aligned with business objectives, regulatory constraints, and agreed quality standards throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## When This Engagement Is Appropriate

This engagement is suitable when:
- A project has a clear scope and defined timeline  
- Delivery is performed by internal or third-party teams  
- The project carries identifiable technical or compliance risk  
- Independent governance is required at critical stages  

It is often used for new initiatives, major changes, or regulated deliverables.

---

## Scope of the Engagement

The engagement typically includes:
- Review of project scope, assumptions, and constraints  
- Architectural and design oversight  
- Definition and enforcement of governance checkpoints  
- Review of delivery artifacts and documentation  
- Escalation of risks and misalignment  

The scope is explicitly defined at the start of the engagement.

---

## Duration and Structure

- Engagements are **time-bound** and linked to project phases  
- Governance checkpoints are scheduled at agreed milestones  
- Interaction is primarily review- and decision-driven  

This structure ensures focus and avoids open-ended involvement.

---

## Deliverables

Typical deliverables include:
- Written governance and risk assessments  
- Architectural or design review feedback  
- Decision records and recommendations  
- Summary reports at key milestones  

Deliverables emphasize **clarity and traceability**, not operational detail.

---

## Client Responsibilities

The client is expected to:
- Define project objectives and success criteria  
- Provide access to relevant project materials  
- Ensure timely availability of decision-makers  
- Retain ownership of business and delivery outcomes  

Governance does not replace project ownership.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

This engagement does **not** include:
- Direct project management or delivery execution  
- Staff augmentation or team leadership  
- Guarantees on cost, scope, or schedule  
- Responsibility for third-party contractual performance  

Any extension beyond governance must be explicitly agreed.

---

## Completion and Exit

- The engagement concludes at predefined milestones  
- A final governance summary is provided  
- Responsibility transitions fully to the client  

The objective is **informed completion**, not continued involvement.

---

## Success Criteria

Success is measured by:
- Clear and documented decision-making  
- Reduced delivery and compliance risk  
- Early identification of deviations  
- Improved predictability and control  

---

## Summary

The Project Governance Engagement is designed for organizations that require **structured oversight and independent judgment** during critical delivery phases.

It provides control and clarity without introducing operational dependency or execution responsibility.
