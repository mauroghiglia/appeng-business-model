# Advisory and Governance Retainer

## Objective

The Advisory and Governance Retainer provides **continuous technical governance, mediation, and decision support** for organizations running distributed or hybrid software development initiatives.

Its purpose is to ensure that architectural decisions, delivery practices, and operational choices remain aligned with business objectives, regulatory constraints, and long-term sustainability.

## When This Engagement Is Appropriate

This engagement is suitable when:
- Development is ongoing or long-lived  
- Multiple stakeholders or teams are involved  
- Technical decisions carry medium to high business risk  
- Internal governance capacity is limited or fragmented  

It is particularly effective in regulated or compliance-sensitive environments.

---

## Scope of the Engagement

The retainer typically includes:
- Architectural and technical oversight  
- Review of designs, implementation approaches, and documentation  
- Mediation between business stakeholders and delivery teams  
- Identification and escalation of technical and operational risks  
- Advisory support on compliance-aware design and delivery  

The exact scope is agreed upfront and revisited periodically.

---

## Typical Duration and Cadence

- Engagements are ongoing by design  
- Review cadence is agreed based on project criticality  
- Interaction may include asynchronous reviews, written feedback, and targeted meetings  

This model favors continuity over intermittent intervention.

---

## Deliverables

Deliverables may include:
- Written decision and risk assessments  
- Architectural and governance recommendations  
- Review notes and action items  
- Updated documentation or guidance artifacts  

Deliverables are focused on **decision quality**, not volume.

## Client Responsibilities

For the retainer to be effective, the client is expected to:
- Designate a clear business and technical counterpart  
- Provide timely access to relevant information  
- Accept that some decisions require explicit trade-offs  
- Retain ownership of business priorities and outcomes  

The retainer does not replace internal accountability.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

This engagement does **not** include:
- Direct execution or delivery ownership  
- Staff augmentation or team management  
- Guarantees on delivery timelines or outcomes  
- Responsibility for third-party contractual performance  

Any deviation from these exclusions must be explicitly agreed.

---

## Exit and Review Conditions

- Engagements are reviewed periodically for continued relevance  
- Either party may disengage with appropriate notice  
- The objective is clean handover, not dependency  

The retainer is designed to be valuable, not permanent by default.

---

## Success Criteria

Success is measured by:
- Reduced ambiguity in decision-making  
- Improved architectural and delivery consistency  
- Early identification and mitigation of risk  
- Increased client confidence and autonomy  

---

## Summary

The Advisory and Governance Retainer is intended for organizations that need **ongoing clarity and oversight** without surrendering ownership or control.

It prioritizes continuity, accountability, and long-term system health over short-term optimization.
