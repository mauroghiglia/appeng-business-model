# How to Engage

## Purpose

This document explains **how clients can engage with Application Engineering** in a clear, practical way.

It is intended for decision-makers who need external technical governance, advisory support, or risk control in software initiatives involving distributed teams.

This is not a sales brochure. It is a guide to **working relationships, boundaries, and expectations**.

---

## What We Do

Application Engineering provides **technical governance, advisory support, and mediation** for software initiatives where:

- Delivery is distributed (internal teams, vendors, or hybrid)
- Technical decisions carry business, regulatory, or operational risk
- Clients want control and clarity without micromanaging execution

We do **not** sell development capacity.  
We support **better decisions, stronger governance, and reduced risk**.

## How Engagements Typically Start

Most engagements begin in one of the following ways:

1. A **Technical Assessment** to understand the current situation  
2. A **Project Governance Engagement** for a defined initiative  
3. An **Advisory and Governance Retainer** for ongoing oversight  
4. A **Transition or Recovery Engagement** in situations of disruption  

When uncertainty is high, starting small and scoped is usually the most effective approach.

## Engagement Models (At a Glance)

### Advisory and Governance Retainer
Ongoing governance and advisory support for active delivery environments.

**Best when:**  
You need continuity, mediation, and long-term technical oversight.

---

### Project Governance Engagement
Time-bound governance for a specific project or delivery phase.

**Best when:**  
You need independent oversight without long-term commitment.

---

### Technical Assessment and Due Diligence
Independent evaluation of systems, practices, and risk exposure.

**Best when:**  
You need clarity before investing, changing direction, or taking ownership.

---

### Transition or Recovery Engagement
Short-term intervention to stabilize or realign a troubled initiative.

**Best when:**  
Control has been lost or a critical transition is imminent.

---

## What Clients Can Expect

Clients can expect:
- Clear scope and explicit boundaries  
- Written findings, recommendations, and decision records  
- Transparent communication of risks and trade-offs  
- Respect for client ownership and authority  

There are no hidden responsibilities or implied guarantees.

---

## What Is Explicitly Not Included

Unless explicitly agreed, engagements do not include:
- Staff augmentation or team management  
- Delivery execution or project ownership  
- Guarantees on timelines, cost, or outcomes  
- Assumption of legal or regulatory responsibility  

These boundaries protect both parties.

---

## How Commercial Terms Are Handled

Commercial terms are:
- Discussed directly  
- Aligned with scope and risk  
- Independent from headcount or delivery volume  

Pricing is intentionally not published, as context matters.

---

## How to Proceed

If you are considering an engagement:

1. Identify the **type of uncertainty or risk** you are facing  
2. Select the **smallest engagement** that provides clarity  
3. Use findings to decide next steps deliberately  

If needed, an initial conversation can help determine fit and scope.

---

## Summary

Application Engineering is designed for organizations that prefer:
- Explicit agreements over assumptions  
- Governance over improvisation  
- Long-term sustainability over short-term acceleration  

Engagements are structured to deliver **clarity, control, and informed decision-making**—nothing more, nothing less.
