# Delivery Model

This section explains how engagements are executed in practice.

It covers the delivery philosophy, engagement lifecycle, roles and responsibilities, communication patterns, and risk management approach. The goal is to make delivery predictable and accountable, even in distributed environments.

The focus is on process and governance, not on specific technologies.
