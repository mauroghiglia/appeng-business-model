# GDPR and Legal

This section outlines the legal and regulatory boundaries within which the model operates.

It focuses primarily on GDPR, data protection roles, jurisdictional constraints, and compliance-related responsibilities. The intent is to prevent implicit legal risk and clarify assumptions early.

This content is operational in nature and does not replace formal legal advice.
